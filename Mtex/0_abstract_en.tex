    In contrast to conventional gameplay where the player owns a dedicated game console or gaming PC, cloud gaming, which runs games on a cloud server and streams the game screen, has been attracting attention in the gaming industry. In cloud gaming, the player's device only draws the streamed screen and transmits the player's input, so even poorly performing devices such as smartphones and tablets can provide a high-quality gaming experience. On the other hand, cloud gaming suffers from the response delay between the time a player makes an input and the time it is reflected on the streamed screen. This response delay includes the rendering processing time and stream encoding/decoding processing time in the cloud game server, but the network delay between the cloud game server and the player terminal is particularly significant. In order to guarantee the Quality of Experience (QoE) of cloud gaming players, it is necessary to eliminate this network delay. In this study, we propose a system that eliminates the network latency by applying the mechanism of volunteer computing, which is a framework for utilizing widely distributed computing resources, and by running the cloud game server on a computer geographically closer to the cloud server. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we implemented the system and evaluated the communication performance and the frame rate to measure the QoE in gameplay. The results show that the proposed system can provide services under effective conditions and without degrading the QoE in gameplay.
